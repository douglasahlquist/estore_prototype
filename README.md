1. Describe a general architecture for a distributed, scalable system that would serve as a backend for a hypothetical webstore and shopping cart type application. The requirements would be that individual users would have records of what was purchased and their properties, and be able to return to an existing cart of items if they had a cart that wasn't emptied between sessions by check-out.


2. Implement in code using a bare-bones version of this shopping backend cart and the purchase history component as a 'Proof of Concept. It must understand that different products have certain fixed properties (name, price), and many specific properties (ie, t-shirt sizes, color of hat, flavor of candy, etc). 


The code should be modular enough to easily add new products or integrate with a hypothetical frontend. It should also have the ability for a specified user to return to an existing cart of items, then update the user's purchase history and emptying the cart on check-out.


Please specify your reasoning behind why you implemented this PoC in a certain way and if it differed from the earlier description, and what choices were made when deciding what to implement and what to stub out.
